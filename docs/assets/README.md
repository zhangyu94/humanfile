# Demo assets (`demo.gif`)

This folder holds the **README CLI demo** as a **programmatically rendered** GIF (and MP4), driven by a [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) cassette.

## What gets produced

| File        | Role                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `demo.tape` | Source script VHS executes (terminal size, font, typing, commands, waits).                  |
| `demo.gif`  | Primary README asset; rendered at **1200×600** px (2:1). [README.md](../../README.md) shows it at **600×300** via `<img width height>` so the page layout stays compact while the file stays sharp on high-DPI screens. |
| `demo.mp4`  | Same recording as H.264; useful for previews or docs that accept video.                     |

Re-render whenever **CLI output**, **fonts**, or **layout** change so the recording stays accurate.

## Resolution

The tape targets **1200×600** terminal pixels (font **18**, padding **16**) so `demo.gif` and `demo.mp4` are usable on retina displays and when scaling. The root README still embeds at **600×300** CSS pixels so the fold does not grow; to show full native size, drop the `width` / `height` attributes or set them to `1200` / `600`.

## Prerequisites (programmatic build)

All of this runs on your machine or in CI; nothing is hand-captured.

1. **Node.js** — `npx` must work (the tape runs `npx humanfile …` inside a fresh temp repo, so the published package is exercised like a real user).
2. **VHS** — installs `ttyd` and `ffmpeg` on macOS when using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install vhs
   ```

3. **JetBrains Mono** — matches the committed typography; without it VHS falls back to another monospace face:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono
   ```

4. **zsh** — the tape sets `Set Shell zsh` (default on current macOS).

5. **git** — the hidden setup runs `git init` / `git commit` in a temp directory.

6. **Network** — first `npx humanfile` run may download the package; CI should allow `registry.npmjs.org`.

## Reproduce `demo.gif` from this repo

From the **repository root** (not from `docs/assets/`):

```bash
vhs docs/assets/demo.tape
```

VHS reads `Output` lines inside the tape and writes:

- `docs/assets/demo.gif`
- `docs/assets/demo.mp4`

No other manual steps are required.

### Verify dimensions and size

On macOS:

```bash
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight docs/assets/demo.gif
# Expect 1200×600 while the tape uses Set Width 1200 / Set Height 600 (display size in README is separate).
```

Keep an eye on file size for the README (aim for a few hundred KB; large GIFs hurt load time).

## How the cassette works (short)

- **`Hide` / `Show`:** Creates a disposable git repo under `$TMPDIR`, adds minimal files (`src/`, `docs/specs/`, `LICENSE`, etc.), commits, then `clear` so the visible recording starts cleanly with `ls`.
- **Visible scenes:** `ls` → `npx humanfile init` → `check` → `ls` (rules) → `check src/index.ts` → three `explain` invocations (confirm, readonly, free via `-n`).
- **`Wait+Screen` vs `Sleep`:** Some steps wait for stable text; `explain` uses **fixed `Sleep`** because colored `level:` output breaks plain-text `Wait` regexes and `npx` can be slow under `ttyd`.

Edit **`demo.tape`** to change resolution, font, timing, or commands. **Settings** (`Set Width`, `Set Height`, `Set FontSize`, …) must appear **before** interactive commands in the tape.

## Automation (CI) sketch

You can regenerate in GitHub Actions when `demo.tape` or CLI output changes, then fail if `git diff` shows a stale GIF (or commit from a release bot). Outline:

1. `ubuntu-latest` job with Node 20+.
2. Install VHS per [project docs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) (Linux packages or `go install` + install `ttyd` + `ffmpeg`).
3. Install a monospace font and reference it in the tape, or switch the tape to a font available on runners.
4. `vhs docs/assets/demo.tape`
5. `git diff --exit-code docs/assets/demo.gif` (or commit).

The humanfile maintainers currently re-run VHS **locally** so JetBrains Mono and macOS `zsh` match the checked-in asset; CI is optional.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                    | What to try                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `could not open ttyd` / connection refused | Often transient; re-run. On Linux headless servers, ensure VHS/ttyd can bind localhost.                |
| `timeout waiting for "Screen …"`           | Output text changed; update the `Wait+Screen /regex/` in `demo.tape` or replace with a longer `Sleep`. |
| Wrong or fallback font                     | Install JetBrains Mono (see above), or change `Set FontFamily` in `demo.tape`.                         |
| GIF too large                              | Lower `Set Framerate`, shorten `Sleep` durations, or reduce terminal size slightly.                    |

## Docker alternative

VHS documents a Docker image with dependencies bundled:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/vhs" -w /vhs ghcr.io/charmbracelet/vhs:latest docs/assets/demo.tape
```

The working directory inside the container is the repo root (`-w /vhs`), so `Output docs/assets/...` paths in the tape resolve like a local run.
